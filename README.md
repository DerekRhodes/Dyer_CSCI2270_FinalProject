# Dyer_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
  In my project, I will create a library that will read in text. It will store each unique word, and with that word, each unique word that follows it in the text, as well as the number of times that word has followed the first word. I intend to implement this as two classes. One will represent a unique word as a string and will also contain a data structure of structs for each unique word omediately proceeding it containing a string of that word and an int of the number of times that word follows the original word. This class will have methods for updating this data structure, and managing sorting. The second class will contain a data structure of the first class, and will have methods for updating itself with text its fed.
